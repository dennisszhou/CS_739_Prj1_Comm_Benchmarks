Latency Comparison Numbers
--------------------------
L1 cache reference                           0.5 ns
- Test volatile read from L1 cache
Branch mispredict                            5   ns
- confuse branch predictor?
L2 cache reference                           7   ns                      14x L1 cache
- Purge L1 cache with raw mindless file
Mutex lock/unlock                           25   ns
- Measure lock and unlock several times subtract volatile time out
Main memory reference                      100   ns                      20x L2 cache, 200x L1 cache
- Purge L3 cache with raw mindless file
Compress 1K bytes with Zippy             3,000   ns        3 us
- Try snappy
Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network       10,000   ns       10 us
- Sender receiver code
Read 4K randomly from SSD*             150,000   ns      150 us          ~1GB/sec SSD
Read 1 MB sequentially from memory     250,000   ns      250 us
- prime 1 MB file purge L3 cache and read
Round trip within same datacenter      500,000   ns      500 us
Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD*     1,000,000   ns    1,000 us    1 ms  ~1GB/sec SSD, 4X memory
- Purge L3 cache and read
Disk seek                           10,000,000   ns   10,000 us   10 ms  20x datacenter roundtrip
Read 1 MB sequentially from disk    20,000,000   ns   20,000 us   20 ms  80x memory, 20X SSD
- Purge L3 cache and read
Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA    150,000,000   ns  150,000 us  150 ms
